This page will soon be further updated. Below you find some useful links to start with.

## Pythonistas with useful websites

* [Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/), Assistant Teaching Professor in the iSchool at the University of Washington, created the [online text book](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) _Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python._ Besides basic Python coding instructions, it also provides useful, well-organized information on text analysis and network analysis, among other things.  

* [Chris Albon](https://chrisalbon.com/), Director of Machine Learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, has a website with instructive, easy to follow code examples, ranging from tasks such as [Select Rows With A Certain Value](https://chrisalbon.com/code/python/data_wrangling/pandas_select_rows_containing_values/) to running [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://chrisalbon.com/code/deep_learning/keras/convolutional_neural_network/) in Keras. Albon's website is the most extensive, high-quality Python resource I came across so far. I used it predominantly for data wrangling in Pandas, but it offers much more.  

<!-- Programming Historian (team of Pythonistas who keep each other sharp through peer-review processes). Lots of explaining (also little details that beginners may not know). Aimed at the Humanities (and in my view also highly suitable for social scientists)

Package documentation (some packages provide excellent documentation on how to use them, so also visit their sites).

Libaries for machine learning in Python
Scikit-learn (the one I am using)
Keras
Flair (by Zalando)
Tensorflow
