## Pythonistas' with useful websites

* [Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/), Assistant Teaching Professor in the iSchool at the University of Washington, created the [online text book](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) _Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python._ Besides basic Python coding instructions, it also provides information on text analysis and network analysis, among others.  

* [Chris Albon](https://chrisalbon.com/), Director of Machine Learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, has a website with instructive, easy to follow code examples, ranging from tasks such as [Select Rows With A Certain Value](https://chrisalbon.com/code/python/data_wrangling/pandas_select_rows_containing_values/) to running [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://chrisalbon.com/code/deep_learning/keras/convolutional_neural_network/) in Keras. Albon's website is the most extensive, useful Python resource I came across so far. I used it predominantly for data wrangling in Pandas, but it offers much more.
