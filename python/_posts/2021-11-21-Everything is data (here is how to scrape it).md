"Everything is data!," a Sociology professor at the University of Amsterdam once said. This idea always stuck with me and I believe that with today's scraping technologies the professor's words became even more meaningful.

Here is a scraper built with Selenium and BeautifulSoup4 to take full advantage of the heaps of data that you can gather online. Also a big shout out to Anna Keuchenius and Javier Garcia from [Computational Social and Behavioral Science](https://csbs.club/) for hosting the workshop that provided the basis for this code.

## The code

Here is how to get there.

First, you need a working Python programming environment (for this I strongly recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)). In the scripts below, I assume that you have Anaconda installed. If this is the case, then you just need to install the _Selenium package_ seperately. If you are not working with Anaconda, then you also need to install the _Pandas_ and _BeautifulSoup4_ packages. [This page](https://renswilderom.github.io/blog/python/2021-11-22-How-to-get-started-with-Python/) will help you to get started with Python and its various packages).
