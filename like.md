People _love_ to share what they like (think, for example, about all the social media posts or dinner table conversations where someone is lyrically telling about a recently discovered restaurant, Netflix show, or book). Cultural sociologists, in their turn, become enthusiastic when discussing _why_ people love to do this. Here, however, I will refrain from such sociological reflexivity and simply share with you my favorites of the moment.

[Winds of Change](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/wind-of-change-cia-propaganda-cold-war-podcast-1027873/){:target="_blank"} 

Some of the most fascinating discoveries I’ve made in recent years have been through podcasts. This one explores whether the CIA exerts "soft power" by influencing cultural production—specifically, whether they had a hand in shaping the 1980s ballad rock band, The Scorpions. It’s a wild and intriguing story, to say the least! :)
