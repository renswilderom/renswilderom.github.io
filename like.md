People _love_ to share what they like (think, for example, about all the social media posts or dinner table conversations where someone is lyrically telling about a recently discovered restaurant, Netflix show, or book). Cultural sociologists, in their turn, become enthusiastic when talking about _why_ people love to share what they consume. In this section, however, I will refrain from such sociological reflexivity and simply share with you my favorites of the moment.  

_What am I watching?_
> [Netflix's Feel Good](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/feel_good/s01) (gay, addiction, British, humor).

_What am I reading?_
> [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets#Chapter_1:_The_Worst_Birthday) (the wizard who needs no explaining).

_What am I listening to?_
> [Nice white parents](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/podcasts/nice-white-parents-serial.html) (podcast, morality, ethnography, 10/10).
