People _love_ to share what they like (think, for example, about all the social media posts or dinner table conversations where someone is lyrically telling about a recently discovered restaurant, Netflix show, or book). Cultural sociologists, in their turn, become enthusiastic when discussing _why_ people love to do this. Here, however, I will refrain from such sociological reflexivity and simply share with you my favorites of the moment.  

_What am I watching?_
* [Netflix's The Last Kingdom](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_last_kingdom){:target="_blank"} (Power play between kings, warriors and vikings in the Anglo-Saxon period).

* [Netflix's Feel Good](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/feel_good/s01){:target="_blank"} (addiction, British, humor).

_What am I reading?_
* [The Little Prince](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157993.The_Little_Prince){:target="_blank"} (A classic which you may re-read now and then from the kind, imaginative Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry).

* [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets#Chapter_1:_The_Worst_Birthday){:target="_blank"} (the wizard who needs no explaining).

_What am I listening to?_
* [Winds of Change](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/wind-of-change-cia-propaganda-cold-war-podcast-1027873/){:target="_blank"} (Some of the best things I came across in recent years consist of podcasts. This one asks the question whether the CIA exercises "soft power" through the production of culture, and in particular if they attempted to do so through the 1980s ballad rock band the Scorpions).
* [Nice white parents](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/podcasts/nice-white-parents-serial.html){:target="_blank"} (podcast, morality, ethnography, 10/10).
