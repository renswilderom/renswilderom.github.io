  Here is some guidance in the world of Python programming. Most data science tutorials focus on so-called "data wrangling" (getting your data in shape and analyzable) and/or how to run a given model. But, as analysts we want more: we like to extract meaningful information from, for instance, social network graphs or machine learning algorithms. And this is what the scripts in this blog section will help you to achieve! Each blogpost provides a fully working program, which: i) opens and prepares a dataset; ii) runs a model; and iii) retrieves new information from its output. 

# (Optional) You can disable grouping posts by date.
no_groups: true

# Exclude this example category from the sitemap.
# DON'T USE THIS SETTING IN YOUR CATEGORIES!
sitemap: false
