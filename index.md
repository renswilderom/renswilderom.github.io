Hello 👋 I study all kinds of culture using computational methods. Trained as a Cultural Sociologist, so fond of theory.

I work as a Core Lecturer in Computational Social Sciences at the University of Amsterdam and a Visiting Lecturer at the American University Kyiv, where I teach Introduction to Sociology and Innovations in Society. 

My PhD dissertation [“Genres, webs of fields, and institutional change: The development of dance in the US, UK, and the Netherlands, 1985-2005”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DKHgvI4YEHkV6PB8xV9UpGsJlSC6a1g/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} has recently (27 September, 2023) been completed.

I am currently setting up a new project titled [“How style impacts organization: modeling stylistic variations in the film art world”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-keicHpcssowyzRC1oLQQb_1S6maaTzi92CS2AVoF60/edit){:target="_blank"} for which I received a Valorization grant from the Social and Behavioural Data Science Centre at the University of Amsterdam. 

Previously, I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.”

I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.”

The two studies are characterized by rather different substantive domains (dance vs sustainable food), yet they also share a connection due to their focus on how the interplay between change-seeking movements and established actors shapes processes of innovation. My research uses computational and qualitative/historical methods. It draws, predominantly, on the literature from cultural sociology, organization and social movement studies.

I recently received a Valorization grant from the Social and Behavioural Data Science Centre (UvA) to set up a new project titled ["How style impacts organization: modeling stylistic variations in the film art world"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-keicHpcssowyzRC1oLQQb_1S6maaTzi92CS2AVoF60/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. 


 The panel on the left shows you some areas to explore: from an overview of my (upcoming) publications to an about me section which brings you up-to-date about my professional life, to a "like" section on things I am watching, reading, and listening to.

The most important part of this site is the blog section. The conventional [Python](https://renswilderom.github.io/blog/python/) posts provide full-blown scripts with some background information, whereas the [Python shorts](https://renswilderom.github.io/blog/python-shorts/) consist of Jupyter Notebooks that go straight to the code to perform a particular practical/analytical task.

Enjoy, and reach out to me for any questions or suggestions! -->
