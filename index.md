**Cultural Sociologist**

In my research, I explore the interplay between cultural and social structures, such as markets and organizational fields. I study these interactions in the context of music, art and gastronomy, using state-of-the-art computational methods, such as BERTopic, GPT models, and a wide range of data processing techniques. 

In my latest research project, [_"AI-Augmented Cultural Sociology: Guidelines for LLM-Assisted Text Analysis and an Illustrative Example,"_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17GMIdOGSOFJAkbbqWiBqJpNTO2NdjJAUCBRZHJUDs3o/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} currently under review, my co-authors and I explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for large-scale automated text analysis. Using consumer reviews as our data source, we demonstrate how LLMs can reliably identify complex, multifaceted concepts, such as the presence of “personalized service” in reviews on Michelin-starred restaurants.

I am currently working as a Lecturer and Academic Liaison in Bachelor Computational Social Science at the University of Amsterdam. Under the supervision of Alex van Venrooij and Giselinde Kuipers, I defended my [PhD dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DKHgvI4YEHkV6PB8xV9UpGsJlSC6a1g/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}  at the Sociology Department of the University of Amsterdam on September 23, 2023. During my doctoral studies, I spent five months in 2018 as a visiting PhD researcher at the University of Toronto's Sociology Department under Shyon Baumann's supervision. Additionally, I hold a master’s degree in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude) from the University of Amsterdam.

<!-- I am a Core Lecturer in Computational Social Sciences at the University of Amsterdam and a Visiting Lecturer at the School of Business Administration at the American University Kyiv.

I work as a Core Lecturer in Computational Social Sciences at the University of Amsterdam and a Visiting Lecturer at the American University Kyiv, where I teach Introduction to Sociology and Innovations in Society. 

My PhD dissertation [“Genres, webs of fields, and institutional change: The development of dance in the US, UK, and the Netherlands, 1985-2005”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DKHgvI4YEHkV6PB8xV9UpGsJlSC6a1g/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} has recently (27 September, 2023) been completed.

I am currently setting up a new project titled [“How style impacts organization: modeling stylistic variations in the film art world”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-keicHpcssowyzRC1oLQQb_1S6maaTzi92CS2AVoF60/edit){:target="_blank"} for which I received a Valorization grant from the Social and Behavioural Data Science Centre at the University of Amsterdam. 

Previously, I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.”

I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.”

The two studies are characterized by rather different substantive domains (dance vs sustainable food), yet they also share a connection due to their focus on how the interplay between change-seeking movements and established actors shapes processes of innovation. My research uses computational and qualitative/historical methods. It draws, predominantly, on the literature from cultural sociology, organization and social movement studies.

I recently received a Valorization grant from the Social and Behavioural Data Science Centre (UvA) to set up a new project titled ["How style impacts organization: modeling stylistic variations in the film art world"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-keicHpcssowyzRC1oLQQb_1S6maaTzi92CS2AVoF60/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. 


 The panel on the left shows you some areas to explore: from an overview of my (upcoming) publications to an about me section which brings you up-to-date about my professional life, to a "like" section on things I am watching, reading, and listening to.

The most important part of this site is the blog section. The conventional [Python](https://renswilderom.github.io/blog/python/) posts provide full-blown scripts with some background information, whereas the [Python shorts](https://renswilderom.github.io/blog/python-shorts/) consist of Jupyter Notebooks that go straight to the code to perform a particular practical/analytical task.

Enjoy, and reach out to me for any questions or suggestions! -->
