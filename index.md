I am a Core Lecturer in Computational Social Sciences at the University of Amsterdam and an Assistant Professor at the School of Business Administration at the American University Kyiv.

The defense of my PhD dissertation [“Genres, webs of fields, and institutional change: The development of dance in the US, UK, and the Netherlands, 1985-2005”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-DKHgvI4YEHkV6PB8xV9UpGsJlSC6a1g/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} (Sociology Department, University of Amsterdam) is planned for 27 September, 2023. The study is supervised by Alex van Venrooij (University of Amsterdam) and Giselinde Kuipers (KU Leuven).

I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.”

The two studies are characterized by rather different substantive domains (dance vs sustainable food), yet they also share a connection due to their focus on how the interplay between change-seeking movements and established actors shapes processes of innovation. My research uses computational and qualitative/historical methods. It draws, predominantly, on the literature from cultural sociology, organization and social movement studies.

I recently received a Valorization grant from the Social and Behavioural Data Science Centre (UvA) to set up a new project titled ["How style impacts organization: modeling stylistic variations in the film art world"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-keicHpcssowyzRC1oLQQb_1S6maaTzi92CS2AVoF60/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

<!-- The panel on the left shows you some areas to explore: from an overview of my (upcoming) publications to an about me section which brings you up-to-date about my professional life, to a "like" section on things I am watching, reading, and listening to.

The most important part of this site is the blog section. The conventional [Python](https://renswilderom.github.io/blog/python/) posts provide full-blown scripts with some background information, whereas the [Python shorts](https://renswilderom.github.io/blog/python-shorts/) consist of Jupyter Notebooks that go straight to the code to perform a particular practical/analytical task.

Enjoy, and reach out to me for any questions or suggestions! -->
