<!-- ### Academically -->

January 1st, 2022, I started as an Assistent Professor at the School of Business Administration at the American University Kyiv, an offshoot of Arizona State University.

My PhD dissertation “Genres, webs of fields, and institutional change: The development of dance in the US, UK, and the Netherlands, 1985-2005” at the Sociology Department of the University of Amsterdam is almost completed (my PhD defense is planned for the summer of 2022). The study is supervised by Alex van Venrooij (University of Amsterdam) and Giselinde Kuipers (KU Leuven).

I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.”

The two studies are characterized by rather different substantive domains (dance vs sustainable food), yet they also share a connection due to their focus on how the interplay between change-seeking movements and established actors shapes processes of innovation. My research uses both qualitative and quantitative/computational methods  and draws, predominantly, on the literature from cultural sociology, organization theory, and social movement studies.
