**Cultural Sociologist**

My research focuses on the interplay between cultural and social structures in the context of music, art and gastronomy. It uses state-of-the-art computational methods, such as BERTopic, GPT models, and a wide range of data processing techniques. 

In my latest research project, [_"AI-Augmented Cultural Sociology: Guidelines for LLM-Assisted Text Analysis and an Illustrative Example,"_](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tx8jn){:target="_blank"} currently under review, my co-authors and I explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for large-scale automated text analysis. Using consumer reviews as our data source, we demonstrate how LLMs can reliably identify complex, multifaceted concepts, such as the presence of “personalized service” in reviews on Michelin-starred restaurants.

I am currently working as a Lecturer and Academic Liaison in Bachelor Computational Social Science at the University of Amsterdam. Under the supervision of Alex van Venrooij and Giselinde Kuipers, I defended my [PhD dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ph_yEA5k21t3Jn2L4O9ENkx5xq1wVI7Q/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}  at the Sociology Department of the University of Amsterdam on September 23, 2023. During my doctoral studies, I spent five months in 2018 as a visiting PhD researcher at the University of Toronto's Sociology Department under Shyon Baumann's supervision. Additionally, I hold a master’s degree in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude) from the University of Amsterdam.
