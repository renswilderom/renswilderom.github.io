I am currently finalizing my PhD dissertation “Genres, webs of fields, and institutional change: The development of dance in the US, UK, and the Netherlands, 1985-2005” at the Sociology Department of the University of Amsterdam. The study is supervised by Alex van Venrooij (University of Amsterdam) and Giselinde Kuipers (KU Leuven).

I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.” There is a strong link between the two projects, as both are concerned with how the interplay between change-seeking movements and established actors affects how processes of innovation enfold. This question is studied using qualitative and quantitative methods, and literature from cultural sociology and organization studies.
