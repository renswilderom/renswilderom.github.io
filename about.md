**Cultural Sociologist**

My work focuses on the interplay between cultural and social structures in the context of music, art and gastronomy. It uses state-of-the-art computational methods, such as BERTopic, GPT models, and a wide range of data processing techniques. 

In my latest project, [_"AI-Augmented Cultural Sociology: Guidelines for LLM-Assisted Text Analysis and an Illustrative Example,"_](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tx8jn){:target="_blank"} currently under review, my co-authors and I explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for large-scale automated text analysis. We demonstrate how LLMs can reliably identify complex, multifaceted concepts, such as the presence of “personalized service” in Google Maps reviews on Michelin-starred restaurants.

I am currently working as a Lecturer in Bachelor Computational Social Science at the University of Amsterdam. I design and teach courses, and, in my role as Academic Liaison, I ensure that there is a good alignment between our academic objectives and the research projects that our students undertake with partner organizations such as Artis and World Waternet. Under the supervision of Alex van Venrooij and Giselinde Kuipers, I defended my [PhD dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ph_yEA5k21t3Jn2L4O9ENkx5xq1wVI7Q/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} at the Sociology Department of the University of Amsterdam on September 23, 2023. During my doctoral studies, I spent five months in 2018 as a visiting PhD researcher at the University of Toronto's Sociology Department under Shyon Baumann's supervision. Additionally, I hold a master’s degree in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude) from the University of Amsterdam.
