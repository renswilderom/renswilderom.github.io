I am currently finalizing my PhD project “Genres, webs of fields, and institutional change: The development of dance in the US, UK, and the Netherlands, 1985-2005” at the Sociology Department of the University of Amsterdam. The study is supervised by Alex van Venrooij (University of Amsterdam) and Giselinde Kuipers (KU Leuven).

Like my master thesis—“The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods” (Cum Laude, Master in Cultural Sociology, University of Amsterdam)—my PhD dissertation is concerned with how the interplay between change-seeking movements and established institutions and actors affects processes of innovation. This question is studied using qualitative and quantitative methods, and literature from cultural sociology and organization studies.
