I am currently finalizing my PhD dissertation “Genres, webs of fields, and institutional change: The development of dance in the US, UK, and the Netherlands, 1985-2005” at the Sociology Department of the University of Amsterdam. The study is supervised by Alex van Venrooij (University of Amsterdam) and Giselinde Kuipers (KU Leuven).

I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.”

The two studies are characterized by rather different substantive domains (dance vs sustainable food), yet they are also importantly connected due to their shared focus on how the interplay between change-seeking movements and established actors affects processes of innovation. This question is studied using qualitative and quantitative methods and by drawing on literature from cultural sociology and organization studies, among others.
